## `About Stellar Universe`

[Stellar Universe](http://www.facebook.com/stellaruniverse1) is a student science initiative started by students of Dyal Singh College, Delhi University in 2017. Their main motivation behind this wonderful idea was passion for scientific research and enhancement of knowledge of advanced topics like Astrophysics, General Relativity and the like right from undergraduate level. This small group of college friends soon grew into a 500+ strong network of science enthusiasts across the nation and abroad. With immense help from institutions like Nehru Planetarium, and guidance from experts of the field such as Dr. N. Rathnasree (Director, Nehru Planetarium, Delhi), Dr. Neeraj Saxena (Advisor -II , AICTE) and Dr. Shibesh Kumar (Prof, VIT). Stellar Universe has organized scores of webinars, seminars, lecture sessions by eminent scientists, group activities, interactive workshops, etc. We are keen and frequent organizers and initiators of immersive hands-on activities in Python Programming, astronomy sky watch sessions, full-fledged lecture courses in General Relativity and Gravity, and research projects in various quarters possibly leading to publishing of scientific papers/articles. All these facilities and activities are fully free of cost, highlighting their passion towards the subject, and the endeavour to make it accessible to students/science enthusiasts irrespective of their background. Stellar Universe is active across all social media platforms enabling interested persons to get notified and participate in such events. Our WhatsApp group is a particularly active one, where students inform each other of similar events, post interesting reads relating to the field, and even get their doubts cleared through peer-learning. There are also regular updates regarding latest research works in Physics. This fully student science initiative has proven to be extremely beneficial to nurture the seeds of science and research-oriented studies in young and brilliant minds all over the globe.
